# DC20 Clerk

**DC20 Clerk** is a modular, full-stack web application designed to support gameplay for the tabletop RPG system **DC20**. It serves as both a learning platform for modern web development practices and a portfolio project demonstrating microservices architecture, CI/CD, and scalable design.

---

## Project Overview

DC20 Clerk is a suite of interactive utilities for players and Game Masters, including:

- A character sheet manager with stat calculations and version history
- A spell/ item/ monster library with support for custom creation
- A searchable rules reference
- A combat tracker with true random dice rolling
- A social system for managing encounters and shared sessions

While a typical VTT (Virtual Table Top) is a full replacement of the in-person tabletop experience, DC20 Clerk is intended more as a TTA (Table Top Assistant) for streamlining the in-person experience, or for providing a simpler way to play online without all the complexity of a VTT.
